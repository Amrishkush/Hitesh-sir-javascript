--Javascript is synchronous by default means code executes one by one
--Javascript is single threaded Its slow if we only use js engine but it will become fast as its always found in runtime environment like browser nodejs so it does not effect more
--Synchronous and single threaded is default behaviour of --Javascript
--Study execution context -it execute one line of code at a time ---each operation waits for the last one to completer before executing.

-------------codes are written in two way blocking code and no blocking code------------
Blocking Code means -- Block the flow of program until something is not done --read file sync
Non Blocking code means --- does not block execution --read file async
